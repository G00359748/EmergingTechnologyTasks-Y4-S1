Tasks 2020

These are my solutions to the tasks assessment.The author is Shane McCormack (G00359748@gmit.ie)

Assessment Details

We were given tasks to complete which were to be coded in python using Jupyter Notebook.All task were realeased on different dates

How to run this project

1.First you have to clone the repository
2.Put into a folder set up for your git repository
3.Run Jupyter Notebook on ur command line inside the folder

Tasks Information

Task 1

The first task was to write a function which required you to calculate the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places.I researched this watching tutorials on how to calculate square roots of number to give me an idea how to do this function.

Task 2

The second task was to do with the Chi Squared test for independence.In the task scipy stats was used to confirm that the Chi Squared value of 24.6 was the correct value.

Task 3

What was required for the third task was to research the two excel functions STDEV.P and STDEV.S.Then numpty was used to perform a simulation demonstraing that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estiate for the standared deviation of a population when performed on a sample

Task 4

The goals of this fourth and final task were to use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisherâ€™s famous Iris data set, explain in a Markdown cell how your code works and how accurate it might be, explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species of iris.
